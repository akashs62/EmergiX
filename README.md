## Getting Started ⚙️
1. **Clone the repository.**
2. **Start the local server**: 
   Since EmergiX utilizes external API requests and React `.jsx` via Babel, it must be accessed on a local server (e.g., using `serve` or `live-server`).
   ```bash
   npx serve . -p 3000
   ```
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` via your browser.

## File Structure 📁
